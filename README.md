# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System

Summary:
This is a full stack application I made as my final capstone project for the Thinkful engineering bootcamp. I utilized React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL for the project.


Project Task:
> You have been hired as a full stack developer at _Periodic Tables_, a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants.
> The software is used only by restaurant personnel when a customer calls to request a reservation.
> At this point, the customers will not access the system online.

**Dashboard**
The dashboard page lists all reservations for a particular date, as well as a list of all created tables. The user is given the option to seat or edit the reservation from this screen.
